Hey {{user.username}}
First off, I want to hand you a coffee, give you a big hug and officially welcome you!

If you're wondering who I am and what this blog is all about- because surprise! it isn't all about being a programmer who spends most of his day writing documentation and talking only to his laptop.

I do other kinds of completely normal things too, like debate personal preferences with people who disagree as a bonding exercise, fret over whether or not I should talk to the intellectual beauty in Data science, also eat.
